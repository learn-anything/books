- If you can't find the year the book was written in, you can skip adding the year.
- If the book is free, link to the free book and add üìñ emoji.
- If the book is not free, link to the book on [goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/) and add üìï emoji.
- The book should be put into its appropriate category. Pick the one you think is closest if you are not sure.
- Sort the books inside a category from most recent to oldest.
- Only add books you think are awesome.
- If you want to add a link to notes for the book, add it below the book as subdashed point.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
