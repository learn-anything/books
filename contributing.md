- If the book is not free, link to the book on [goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/) and add 📕 emoji.
- The book should be put into its appropriate category. Pick the one you think is closest if you are not sure.
- Only add books you think are awesome.
- If you want to add a link to notes for the book, add it below the book as subdashed point.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
